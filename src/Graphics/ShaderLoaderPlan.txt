New Primitives:


  enum VertexFormat;
    - This describes how the data from the mesh is loaded
      in a vertex. Each vertex format has a default
      shader for either a texture, color, or both.

  enum ShaderName;
    - This describes the shader name to use which will be 
      developed against and mapped/initialized. It is used
      tp index into a 2d map where the outer map has a vertex format enum 
      and the inner map index has the ShaderName enum, what is returned is
      some index to be shared amongst api level shader implementations.




Shader Changes:

  
  
  Move:
    - Move the openGL API specific implememntations from the source code.
  
  Add: 
    - Add a function in constructor that reads and stores vertex format.
